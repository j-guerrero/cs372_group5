Diary:

1st Entry:
My partner (Josh) and I haven't begun any real work on the project yet, but we have agreed to do it in C++. I'm glad we can simply do it vs an AI,
because that means we don't need to worry about how to handle switching between players.

2nd Entry:
Josh set up the repository, and it works! It turns out our schedules don't align very well, so we may do most of this project asynchronously over
the internet, and re-group in class.

3rd Entry:
Neither of us appear very driven to get going on this project, at least until our first pair-programming session. But we have begun to hash out
various requirements and user stories.

It's occurred to me that I should probably start dating my entries. Today was our first pair-programming session. After having to figure out how
to get "catch.hpp" to work with Assignment 2, I saw how easy it was and decided that's probably the right way to go for unit-testing our project.
So, I spent some time before class studying how to use it a bit.
I liked pair-programming, honestly. The only thing I was worried about was that I would look stupid in front of my partner if I had to Google
something basic I'd forgotten how to do. Or if, when we switched places, whether or not I'd know where he was going with his code well enough to
continue it. But my studying of Catch a little earlier proved totally useful, and we made a good team because he set up the class and
everything first, then I set up the unit tests. I think my favorite thing about pair programming so far is that if one programmer gets a brain
fart on something basic, the time spent trying to remember it is immediately glossed over by the partner watching. This keeps the momentum going.

Josh presented today. We're going to need to sit down soon and make some real progress before next Friday. I think it'll be easy to get somewhere
though. It's simply a matter of setting aside the time to DO it.
