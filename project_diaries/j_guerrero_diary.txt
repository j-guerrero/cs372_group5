=== February 8, 2016 - Monday ===

	Created repository for group project and set up file directories. Plan to get together and start working out how we are going to go through documentation before Wednesday.

=== February 17, 2016 - Thursday ===
Did some pair-programming and learned how to properly use “cache.hpp” for testing. Made a quick requirements document and chose one to focus on. Really enjoy pair-programming for the fact, while it takes longer, it’s easier to break down and solve any problems we run into (at least for now).

=== February 19,2016 - Friday ===
Gave a quick presentation on one of our requirements and our process for testing. Currently in the process of writing up an official requirements document. Need to start creating a prototype to demonstrate with to the class on this upcoming Friday.
